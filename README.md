The Grid2op platform can be installed as any python package with (if you want to only install grid2op - otherwise do the previous command from the starting-kit):

>pip install grid2op


Similarly the "baseline" python package can be installed with:

>pip install l2rpn-baselines

The instructions to get the same environment as the one used for evaluating your agent can be found at https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/233.
